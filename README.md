# SpeedPing

**SpeedPing** is a lightweight, cross-platform network diagnostics tool built with Go and [MiQT](https://github.com/mappu/miqt).  
It combines three essential functions into one clean interface:

- **Ping Monitor** â€” keep track of multiple hosts simultaneously, with realtime charts showing latency and packet loss.  
- **Speed Test** â€” run bandwidth tests powered by bundled [iperf3](https://github.com/esnet/iperf) binaries, with live graphs of throughput.
- **Traceroute** - SpeedPing provides an interactive and animated view of network hops and latency in real time.

The app is designed to be small, fast, and ergonomic â€” perfect for homelabbers, sysadmins, and anyone who needs quick visibility into network performance.
